# Data Structures and Algorithms – COMP 202

This repository contains all my **assignments for the Data Structures and Algorithms (COMP 202)** course.  
All programs are written in **C** and organized according to each question number.  
The purpose of this repository is to **practice and demonstrate fundamental data structures and algorithms**, including stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, heaps, and sorting techniques.

## Folder Structure
Each program is implemented in a **separate source file**, named as `prog_<q>.c`, where `<q>` is the question number.  
Documentation for each program is provided in Markdown files, named as `doc_<q>.md`.
